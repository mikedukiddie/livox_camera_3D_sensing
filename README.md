# Use Livox MID360 & Fastlio SLAM
- Installation  
This setup is tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS2 humble. For general installtion guidance, we can follow [this link](https://www.cnblogs.com/oliudaneng/p/18964156). The "save_map" function should be activated through some files changes. I will update this later.
